# codingTasks

Welcome to the `codingTasks` repository! This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various basic concepts in Python that I have learned. The repository is organized into the following directories:

## Directories

### /inheritance/
This directory contains examples of inheritance in Python.

- **method_override.py**: This script demonstrates method overriding in a child class. A method in the child class has the same name as a method in the parent class but provides a different implementation.
- **practical_task_1.py**: This script shows how a child class inherits from a parent class. It includes examples of how the child class can access properties and methods of the parent class.

### /recursion/
This directory contains examples of recursion in Python.

- **largest_number.py**: This script finds the largest number in a list of numbers using a recursive function. It compares each number with the largest number found in the rest of the list.
- **sum_recursion.py**: This script recursively adds up numbers in a list up to a given index. It demonstrates how to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems.

### /strings_lists_and_dictionaries/
This directory demonstrates list comprehension, list methods, string manipulation, and dictionary comprehension in Python.

- **alternativeLetter.py**: This script manipulates an input string and outputs the string with each alternative letter capitalized. It uses string manipulation techniques to achieve the desired format.
- **alternativeWord.py**: This script outputs each alternative word capitalized. It splits the input text into words and capitalizes every other word.
- **cafe.py**: This script demonstrates dictionary comprehension by creating dictionaries for the stock and for the price of each item in a cafe. It calculates and outputs the total worth of the cafe's inventory.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codingTasks.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory of the concept you want to explore:
   ```sh
   cd codingTasks/inheritance
   ```
3. Run the Python files to see the concepts in action:
    ```sh
    python method_override.py
    ```

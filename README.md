This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating basic concepts in Python that I have learned. These scripts are organized into directories based on the concepts they illustrate, such as inheritance, recursion, and manipulation of strings, lists, and dictionaries. Each script contains examples and practical tasks that are essential for understanding and mastering these concepts.

## Directories and Files

### Inheritance
This directory contains:
- **method_override.py**: This script demonstrates method overriding in a child class. A method in the child class has the same name as a method in the parent class but provides a different implementation.
- **practical_task_1.py**: This script shows how a child class inherits from a parent class. It includes examples of how the child class can access properties and methods of the parent class.

### Recursion
This directory contains:
- **largest_number.py**: This script finds the largest number in a list of numbers using a recursive function. It compares each number with the largest number found in the rest of the list.
- **sum_recursion.py**: This script recursively adds up numbers in a list up to a given index. It demonstrates how to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems.

### Strings, Lists, and Dictionaries
This directory demonstrates list comprehension, list methods, string manipulation, and dictionary comprehension. It contains:
- **alternativeLetter.py**: This script manipulates an input string and outputs the string with each alternative letter capitalized. It uses string manipulation techniques to achieve the desired format.
- **alternativeWord.py**: This script outputs each alternative word capitalized. It splits the input text into words and capitalizes every other word.
- **cafe.py**: This script demonstrates dictionary comprehension by creating dictionaries for the stock and for the price of each item in a cafe. It calculates and outputs the total worth of the cafe's inventory.

## Installation

To run the scripts in this repository, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
     
      
      git clone https://github.com/javerria/codingTasks.git
      

Navigate to the directory containing the script you wish to run.

## Usage

To use any of the scripts, navigate to the appropriate directory and run the script using Python. For example:
     
      
      cd inheritance
      python method_override.py
